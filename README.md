## Overview

This project will generate a unique, 10-second recording of music and play it repeatedly. On every play, the audio data will be corrupted.

This project uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).

## Installation

> Access to the required audio samples from unrecognized domains (including `localhost`) is intentionally blocked by CORS. You will need to supply your own samples files and modify the code to run this locally. Audio samples can be found in [samples.generative.fm](https://github.com/generative-music/samples.generative.fm).

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone to your machine.
2. Navigate to the project's directory.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
